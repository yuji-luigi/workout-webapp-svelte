1. choose from routine.
  - routine has all so you are all step
2. choose from workout
  - choose workout
  example A
      name: Pull up
      type: reps and sets
      timer: 90sec
  Work out has all this configurations
   example B
      name: Pull up
      type: HIIT
      timer: [{90sec, 30sec}, {90sec, 30sec}, {90sec, 30sec}] // {active, rest}

Approach 2.
Timer base.
Choose timer.
<Example Reps and sets>
  starts timer and count up. tap to and count down the seconds
    name: reps and sets
    type: reps_and_sets
    seconds: 90sec

<Example EMOM>
  starts timer and only countdown. finish and start countdown again. until given number of sets are done.  
    name: timer.secondsActive + timer.secondsRest

<Example HIIT>
  starts timer and only countdown. finish and start countdown again. Timer should be tuple of [int, int] => [active, rest] 
    name: timer.secondsActive + timer.secondsRest
  Problem seconds field is int it should not be a tuple

<Example Abs>
  starts timer and only countdown. finish and start countdown again. Timer is array of object {name, description, exercise_id, seconds}
    name: timer.secondsActive + timer.secondsRest
  Problem seconds field is int it should not be a tuple

NOTE: The rest time is not a Exercise. It can be like pseudo Timer without creating a record.
NOTE: May be Timer object should contain seconds: int and also restSeconds: int
